# Code-301--lab-02--JQuery
In this project, I am dynamically populating images on my webpage, extracted from a Json platform, and using JQuery to dynamically display and filter each image. 

Essentially, I am trying, as a user, to view the images on the page so that I can browse through the photo collection
